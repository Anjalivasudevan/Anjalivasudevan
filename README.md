- 🌱 I’m currently learning **bioinformatics pipelines**, **Python**, and **variant calling workflows using the Galaxy platform**  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on **open-source bioinformatics tools**, student research projects, or anything involving **transcriptomics or bacterial genome analysis**  
- 📫 How to reach me: (mailto: anjali7251285@gmail.com )
